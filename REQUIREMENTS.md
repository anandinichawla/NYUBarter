### Requirements

  **Stakeholder:** *Insert Stakeholder interview stuff.* 
  
  **End-user observation:** 
  
  - Stereotype Persona:
     - Andrew a student who needs to buy a textbook
     - Lisa a student who needs to buy a microwave for her dorm
     - Andrew might need a $100 textbook for an upcoming class. 
     Andrew can make a request through the app, and Lisa who has the textbook
     can search through Andrew’s profile to see if there’s anything she’d like in 
     exchange. Let’s say Andrew has a functional microwave that’s no longer needed
     for their apartment (maybe their roommate has a better one). If Lisa wants to
     make a trade, she can submit a trade request, and if approved by Andrew who 
     wants the textbook, the transaction will then take place.
    
  - Real-life end users:
     - Santiago one of our own group members bought a mini fridge for his dorm last year.
     This year he is off campus and his apartment came with a huge fridge to meet all
     his needs. So, not wanting to go through the hassle of going though a selling service
     like eBay which would require expensive shipping fees making the profit from his effort
     almost pointless he just kept it even though it is useless to him and takes up unnecessary
     space.
    
     - Ivanna a friend of Santiago wanted to buy a dresser for her clothes, so she went on a
     Facebook group ment for buying stuff people do not need and went to go and pick up a dresser
     for a cheap price. Turns out the dresser was broken and the seller had been lying about it's
     condition. Our app would allow this kind of behavior to be reported, and allow users to have
     a feedback rating so that you do not have to deal with fraudulent locals like when using a 
     facebook group or craigslist.
