### Requirements

  **Stakeholder:** *Insert Stakeholder interview stuff.* 
  
  **End-user observation:** 
  
  - Stereotype Persona:
     - Andrew a student who if frustrated since he cannot find a cheap textbook
     for his upcoming Economics class.
     - Lisa a student who spent a lot of money on setting up her dorm and still 
     needs to buy a microwave, but has little money left.
     - John who needs to get rid of his old couch, and does not want to simply throw it away 
     and lose all it's value he spent on it.
    
  - Real-life end users:
     - Santiago one of our own group members bought a mini fridge for his dorm last year.
     This year he is off campus and his apartment came with a huge fridge to meet all
     his needs. So, not wanting to go through the hassle of going though a selling service
     like eBay which would require expensive shipping fees making the profit from his effort
     almost pointless he just kept it even though it is useless to him and takes up unnecessary
     space.
     - Ivanna a friend of Santiago wanted to buy a dresser for her clothes, so she went on a
     Facebook group ment for buying stuff people do not need and went to go and pick up a dresser
     for a cheap price. Turns out the dresser was broken and the seller had been lying about it's
     condition. Our app would allow this kind of behavior to be reported, and allow users to have
     a feedback rating so that you do not have to deal with fraudulent locals like when using a 
     facebook group or craigslist.
