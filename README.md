# NYU BARTER

## Project Description
NYU Barter is a mobile application that allows users to trade items they don't want in exchange for items posted by other users. Users will be allowed to post items to trade, pick items that they would be willing to trade for and start a chat if two users happen to be interested in each other's items.

## Project History
The project came about after observing college students on online marketplaces. Given their circumstances, most students buy and sell things such as books and furniture on a frequent basis. However, with this platform, they now have a direct channel to get rid of things they don't need in exchange for things that they want. For instance a student could use the platform to trade books they longer need for books they'll need in the following semester.

This project is currently being developed as part of NYU's Agile Software Development and DevOps course.
