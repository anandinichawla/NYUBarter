# Contributing

Before contributing please email one of the developers or message them on slack (if you are in the class)

Our organization holds a standard code of conduct that must be followed

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers.


### Our Pledge

We aim to create a product where users can freely trade items with another.
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

### Team Norms

* We hold a strong value for clean and concise user experiences and customer satisfaction
* Each team member will do an equal share of work
* Conflicts will be brought up to a vote between all three members
* The majority of votes will be what the team agrees. Ideally each vote should be unanimous
* Our sprint cadence is mandated through the course schedule
* Standups will occur Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 1pm.
* Wednesday standup will be a mandatory meetup but Monday and Friday will be remote or on location
* All work created by one team member is THEIR work and should not be used to cover for another member.
* Frequently absent members will be reported to the professor
* Any team member that lacks on contribution without proper excuse will be reported
* Messages should be responded to within 30 minutes and 2 hours at most during week days and work hours.
* Priority of the backlog will be discussed after Friday standup before each sprint
